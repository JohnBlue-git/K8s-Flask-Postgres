## Docker and Kubernetes (k8s)

These are technologies for developing and deploying software in a more efficient, scalable, and resilient way.
\
Together, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services represent a modern belief system in software delivery—**agile**, **scalable**, and **resilient**. They empower developers and businesses to bring ideas to life faster, more reliably, and with greater flexibility than ever before.

### **Docker** – *“Package once, run anywhere.”*

A tool to package applications along with its dependencies or environments that makes deployment much easier.


### **Kubernetes (K8s)** – *“Automate and scale with confidence.”*

They automatically manage containerized applications (deploy, replicate, healing, load balancing,…) that reduce manual intervention and make manage of service more easy and scalable.

### **Cloud Services** – *“Build globally, operate seamlessly.”*

We believe in **accessibility and innovation without infrastructure constraints**. Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide on-demand resources, enabling teams to focus on delivering value instead of managing servers. The cloud empowers organizations to experiment, deploy globally, and scale effortlessly.
